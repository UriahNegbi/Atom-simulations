An open-source project for simulating atomic structures.

# 💡 **Goals**  
Our goal is to build the best open-source Atom Simulator, allowing users to calculate and understand the properties of atoms in a simple, effective, and accurate way.

# 🌟 **Features**  
Mass Calculation: Computes the mass of atoms based on their protons, neutrons, electrons, and provides the atomic weight in kg.
Stability Check: Predicts whether an atom is stable or unstable with an accuracy of 60-70%.
Element Recognition: Supports all 118 elements from the periodic table.
Ion Calculation: Provides highly accurate ion charge calculations with a 90-95% success rate.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy to use for both casual learners and advanced users.
